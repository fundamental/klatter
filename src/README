Klatter - A Trivial Formant Based Phoneme Synthesizer
=====================================================
Mark McCurry

Klatter is a bare bones formant synthesizer based upon the description given in
the 1979 paper "Software For a Cascade/Parallel Formant Synthesizer" by Dennis
Klatt.
This program was not designed for interactive use, though there is code for some
minimal midi control.
In it's current state, it is enough of a curiosity that it will be preserved,
though it may not see much if any use.

Architecture
------------

Code is broken into three categories

DSP::   Any code performing the actual synthesis
Param:: Any code holding the parameters for synthesis and the speech model
glue::  Code connecting the parameters and synthesis to the system output (JACK)
